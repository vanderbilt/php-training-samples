# Don't Repeat Yourself

## Concepts
* Centralize repeated code (like the "new InstitutionObject()" calls)
* Is it okay to reuse a variable name if the values change? 
* Note that the Doc Blocks are not DRY - They repeat the information in the code
* When have you over-generalized? Should getOrCreateInstitution() take two parameters, or should this be two different methods?
*
